we cannot send the image to the backend because bydefault the form sends url encoded data to the backend 

when we want to send files through html forms we should change the encoding type of the form . 
type = multipart/encodingData 

multer npm package for multiform data 
it creates uploads folder , and in the post middleware we should specify the file field name ,
