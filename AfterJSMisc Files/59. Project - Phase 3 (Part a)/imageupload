we cannot send the image to the backend because bydefault the form sends url encoded data to the backend 

when we want to send files through html forms we should change the encoding type of the form . 
type = multipart/encodingData 

multer npm package for multiform data 
it creates uploads folder , and in the post middleware we should specify the file field name ,


cloud setup -----------
for example cloudinary 
product environment credentials 

sensitive information is not directly written in code , not uploading into the gitHub 

.env file 

to save all these credentials , 

format is fixed , that i skey value pair 
KEY = value 
no space ,quotes between key value pair 
simply Key=Value .

once we save the environmental variable in .env   we can use that in our project anywhere . 


we cannot access this directly from .env 
to access this , third party library 

https://www.npmjs.com/package/dotenv

As early as possible in your application, import and configure dotenv:

import 'dotenv/config'
// console.log(process.env);
// console.log(process.env.KEY);

import dotenv from 'dotenv';
 
if(process.env.NODE_ENV === "development"){
    dotenv.config();
}
if(process.env.NODE_ENV != "production"){
    dotenv.config();
}
console.log(process.env.API_KEY);


SINCE WE ARE IN DEVELOPMENT PHASE 

we will be using env file only in development phase not in production phase .

while deployment we will set the NODE_ENV value to production . 


https://www.npmjs.com/package/multer-storage-cloudinary
https://www.npmjs.com/package/cloudinary

to use this library , we should make an individual file with cloud config name ,

before uploading a file {image in this case } accessing account is must .
