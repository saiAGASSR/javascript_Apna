TillNow we have kept states from boolean , number , we can assign string 

Now Objects 

Ludo game 
has 4 players will be chosing the game 
movies will be calculated . 

Here the thing is we will be having four buttons and count for eacjh color 

moves object should be used instead of using 4 states for each color counts . 

so when we change the property of the object the object will not be changed   . I mean its address is the same 
so  useState will not detect the change and no re rendering o fthe componet willoccur .

this case can be solved using  spread operator .

this will return new array and thus  object change will be detected .
we should use call back functions with prev state    as discussed last module . 


same goes with arrays .
