THEY WILL INITIALIZE  WHEN WE CALL THE  function 
and  deInitialize from the memory   if the execution of the function  is Development

inner function preserves the variables of the outer function

function outer(){
    let b=10;

        function inner(){
            let a =10;
            console.log(a+b)
        }
}
