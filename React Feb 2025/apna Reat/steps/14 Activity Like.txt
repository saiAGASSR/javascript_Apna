It looks like you havenâ€™t installed FontAwesome properly in your Next.js project. Try these steps to fix the issue:

1. Install FontAwesome Packages
Run the following command in your terminal:

2. Check Your Import Statements
After installation, ensure your LikeButton.jsx is correctly importing the icon:

jsx
Copy
Edit


import { FontAwesomeIcon } from '@fortawesome/react-fontawesome';
import { faHeart } from '@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons';

const LikeButton = () => {
    return (
        <div>
            <FontAwesomeIcon icon={faHeart} />
        </div>
    );
}

export default LikeButton;
3. Restart Your Development Server
Sometimes, Next.js needs a restart to recognize newly installed dependencies. Stop your dev server (Ctrl + C) and restart it:

sh
Copy
Edit
npm run dev
