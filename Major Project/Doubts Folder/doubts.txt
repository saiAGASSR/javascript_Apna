Converting AirNub project to React
what type of suggestion are you expecting like @saitejaassr123 
ok
so you just have to components for that and that's it @saitejaassr123
nothing more
in place of ejs templates ? 
ejs ke jagha react function se replace kar dena
can i have any reference if possible
So i just want to  modify views section which contains ejs templates to react components . that is the thing ?

and  also i want to make  ultra modern animations while scrolling down and animations  while opening a listing or anything , how to implement such types ??
