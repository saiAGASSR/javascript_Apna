60. Project - Phase 3 (Part b)
again change the form type to 
formtype encrypt - multiform formdata 


we should remove required tag from the form  for the image field 

in addnew list form we shoul dadd required field ..


In backend 
we should make changes to handle the new change 

as did in the new listing post middleware 
make change in the put middleware adding upload.single ("listing[image])

same changes in the controller section with extracting the  url and filepath from the req.file object . 
but in the updation wea re updating with  find and update query . 
in this query they are passing the req.body object . which doesnot contain the file object which is present in req.file 
if user doesnot provide image 
we should check the req.file object is defined or not . 
In JS to check wether the file is defined or not 
if(   typeOf  req.file  !== "undefined" )




preview section in edit page .. 

to develope a preview section in the edit form so that user will have an idea to change the image or not 

creating a small div and displaying there .

problem  high quality        that wuality is not required we should have general idea preview pixels 

tranformation of images  
cloudinary     pathparams after uploads/ e_blur 

before rendering the edit form   access the image url and using replacing methor 
replace("/upload,"/desided")
